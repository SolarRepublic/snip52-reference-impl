# SNIP-52 Reference Implementation

This is a contract reference implementation for [SNIP-52 Private Push Notification](https://github.com/SolarRepublic/SNIPs/blob/feat/snip-52/SNIP-52.md). It implements a simple chat application that sends two types of private push notifications. The first is a notification to a receiver of a `message` that was sent. The second is a notification of a `reaction` from the receiver back to the original author of the message.

The code for the chat front end application can be found [here](https://github.com/SolarRepublic/snip52-demo).
